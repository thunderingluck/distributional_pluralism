Your willingness to share your genuine thoughts and feelings has sparked meaningful conversations, built a supportive community, and most importantly, fostered empathy among us all. We have seen your kindness, your conviction, and your relentless desire to leverage your experiences to confront the challenges we face both locally and globally. Every day, as we sorted through hundreds of your submissions, it became clear that your diverse perspectives are what make our MIT community truly exceptional. \\n\\nAs we hand over the reins to the next generation of admins, we encourage you to continue this tradition of openness and understanding. Keep sharing, keep caring, and keep fighting to make MIT a place where every voice is heard, especially those that are often silenced. Thank you for trusting us with your stories and for sticking with us through our late-night (and oftentimes mid-morning) posting schedules.

       " 'tw: suicide\\n\\n#72705 #72675 I wish something like your confession had passed my path a year ago.  I lost my aunt to suicide.  My aunt was more like a mom to me -  My mom was in and out of jail and not much of a mom at all.  My aunt and my uncle raised me most of my childhood. As I got older, we weren\\'t as close and I spent less and less time at their home.  I look back at the photo from our last Thanksgiving together, her last Thanksgiving, and I can see the emptiness and sadness in her eyes.  I was too busy to notice it then, but its so apparent now. My uncle said that she was struggling with her inner demons for quite some time, and I wish I had known. I am so appreciative for what she did for me as a child.  I wish I would have been there when she needed me. There are some words that are pretty powerful, \"I love you\",  \"I care about you\" and \"You made a difference in my life\" - I wish I had said them to her. Your message may help others.  I didn\\'t know that my aunt was struggling, and others may have people in their life that they don\\'t know are struggling. There are people in your life that care about you too, that don\\'t know you are struggling, you should open up to them. I think your confession may save others from my heartache. I have started treating every day like it is the last time I will see the people in my life, and I want to know the last words I said to them were kind and caring. If I get angry or in a fight, I think to myself \"Will I be ok if those are my last words to them?\"  It has been humbling and made all the little things I used to get upset about insignificant, and being forgiving is so freeing. Hopefully others can heed your words and not have to lose someone to realize this. You are important, you are cared for, and thank you for being brave enough to share.',\n",

And it feels like I can’t get a single day where things just go right and I don’t feel like shit. And before you say “are you trying to make friends?”, I’m a member of multiple “for fun” clubs but it only ever feels like people talk to me out of necessity. I have tried to make friends with people but everyone already has friends and its impossible for me to be one too. Every night I go in my room and cry to convince myself to not just be another email “they were found in their room.” But all I want to do is just stop existing because I wouldn’t have to feel terrible literally all the fucking time.

Of course we\\'re going to want to help out as much as we can; we feel like we relate to this incident more. Sure, there have been situations overseas that have led to more casualties, but god damn man, just because we don\\'t personally know victims of the bombings doesn\\'t mean we aren\\'t #BostonStrong. Get your head out of your ass and let us, as a school and as a city, come together. Don\\'t tell us what to do.\\n\\nThe \\'confession\\' is posted below. As always, feel free to comment/debate. \\n\\nPersonally, the bombings last year (since they happened 20 minutes after I left the finish line where I was watching the marathon), made me realize that life is precious and short, and that I shouldn\\'t take anything for granted. So, excuse me for wanting to be #BostonStrong.\\n\\nAlso, don\\'t talk shit about this amazing country we live in. Merica.\\n\\n#1233 \\'Can we take a moment to see why the world hates America so much?\\n\\n4 people died. Dozens were injured. #BostonStrong was the most tweeted hashtag for weeks after the event. The One Fund raised over $100 million to support the victims. New Balance is advertising their new \"Boston\" shoes. Someone at Wellesley wrote a song commemorating the occasion, and 100 people sang it on the radio.\\n\\nNow imagine watching all this from the point of view of a man in Syria who just lost his home and family in a bombing. Or from the POV of a Sudanese boy whose arm was cut off via machete by rebel forces. Or from the POV of a human trafficking victim who gets raped every day. Or from the POV of a Vietnamese slave working in triple digit weather building skyscrapers in Dubai.\\n\\nAnd not to mention: most MIT kids don\\'t even know a victim of the bombings. Most of you sat at home watching the TV while police led a wild goose chase for 2 small time terrorists. Please tell me how you are #BostonStrong.\\n\\nTragedies happen every day. What happened to quiet resilience? What happened to keeping your head down and moving on with life when bad things happen?\\n\\nAmericans are the best in the world at blowing smoke up their own arses.

Everyday, as we sorted through hundreds of posts, we were so proud of how much energetic discourse you sparked (amidst the many, many posts about being horny PLEASE check yourselves more y’all 🥲) But forreal, your passion for MIT is so inspiring, especially considering how many hardships we’ve witnessed together. \\n\\nOur time at MIT has been a stressful mix of emotions. We’ve experienced countless Zoom classes and hang-outs, long, dreadful periods of hoping for normalcy, and then, once we did achieve some sense of “normal”, we were suddenly thrown back into MIT without an easy transition and acknowledgment of our pain. All this, of course, was made even harder by the everpresent academic rigors of our school. \\n\\nHowever, you never hesitated to share your sentiments about the state of things with Confessions. This ultimately resulted in other students reading your submissions and potentially feeling more understood, or if they did disagree, hopefully being empowered to openly voice their thoughts. Confessions, then, has been a wonderful tool to further build and strengthen the community at MIT. \\n\\nWe hope that MIT Confessions has been a safe space for you, and that you not only continue building community virtually here, but in your living groups on campus if you’re still a student, or whatever adventures you have next as a graduate! Tell people you love and appreciate them, have conversations about how you’re feeling often, and make sure to schedule time with friends and family. Lean on others and confide in them, it’ll make life so much better! 🥹💗👉👈 Peace out, IHTFP, and best of luck, friends!

After talking to many of them, they would not do that now but saw no escape at the time. If you are considering it, please reach out for professional help because things won't always be like this. One thing struck me, and maybe it is like the confessor that didn't know what to do, but a lot of them said they had reached out to friends or family and it was the silence and lack of care that was so deafening and lonely. I can't image not being a decent human and telling them that you care and that they are a worthwhile person even if you don't know what else to say. Of course you are not responsible for them, but I do think you have the responsibility to be a decent human.  Maybe it was like the person that posted that didn't know what to say and that lead to silence that was taken as not caring. Silence can be very lonely in ones own thoughts.\",\n",

I have been commenting on confessions since my freshman year and helping the page run and grow was always something I wanted to do.  I loved the memes that would develop with the page and seeing the community work together to help each other.  I loved engaging with the community while running confessions.  We had to make some tough decisions throughout the year but with great admins like Faraz and Danielle, I would do it all again.  Please continue to grow this community! \\nPs.  I was very partial to hamster confessions. \\n\\nDani:\\n\\nHi everyone! I’m very happy being able to help post confessions. It was one of the things I’ve looked forward to each day because of the funny comments and wide range of experiences mentioned. I hoped we were able to do the same for you! Thank you for being the ones to continue confessions with your amazing participation!\\n\\nFaraz:\\n\\nIt's been so fulfilling to a part of Confessions behind the scenes. I've always been an avid reader and writer of confessions, of course I hope y'all enjoyed the handful of confessions that I wrote myself this past year 😛 But I hope even more that you enjoyed reading Confessions this year, when we had so many emotions to express. MIT Confessions has always served to connect the MIT community together - from complaining about classes, SOs, UROPs, COVID rules, mental health, and exams, to writing love letters to our zoom crushes, showing our gratitude to our peers, tagging our friends in stupid confessions, and sharing our stories of successful romances. Thank you, readers and writers, for an awesome year!\",\n",
       " 'MIT Confessions has just reached 10k submissions this year!! To celebrate this momentous occasion, the admin team has made extensive use of advanced algorithms and Big Data to present to you some incredible statistics representing the feats you, the community, have achieved!\\n\\nThe most popular time y’all submitted a confession was between 10 and 11 PM (Eastern), with 6.5% of all submissions being received in that hour. The least popular time was between 5 and 6 AM with only 1.2% of all submissions. (Of course, our posting schedule is quite different :p)\\n\\nThe most discussed class is 6.009 (Fundamentals of Programming) with 80 unique mentions.  This class boasts an enrollment of about 360 each semester, so at most 11.1% of this year’s 6.009 students have posted a confession about it this year :)\\nHonorable mentions go to 6.031 (Software Construction) with 69 mentions (nice), and 6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms) with 60 mentions. Wow, that’s a lot of six...\\n\\nMIT is mentioned 1861 times (fun fact, this was the year MIT was founded, WOW!) Harvard was mentioned only 65 times - so MIT got a 97% which is an A+! And Harvard got only 3% - which is also an A for them. (Oh, and Wellesley got mentioned 8 times.)\\n\\nLove is mentioned 521 times while hate is mentioned 278 (wow, we’re so wholesome! :33) We got 119 mentions of ‘Boyfriend’ and 100 of ‘Girlfriend’ - close enough to our own gender distribution! \\n\\nWe MIT students are renowned across the world for having a lot of sex. Appropriately, we had a wide swath of confessions about all the incredible, passionate sex we’re having. We had 1088 mentions of fuck/fucked/fucking; 149 mentions of sex; 74 mentions of horny; 69 mentions of harder (nice) and 68 of dick (so close!!), 13 mentions of shoes, 20 mentions of pussy/vagina/coochie, 16 of tits/titty/titties/tiddy/tiddies and 41 mentions of boob/boobs. Y’all are really fucking horny, holy hell!! BONKKKKK\\n\\nThis year has brought with us unprecedented changes, including a brand new dorm! Confessions submitters welcomed New Vassar (40 times) but only six submissions called West Campus’s latest addition “West Garage”. Of course, the other major change this year - the pandemic - was indeed reflected in our confessions. We had over 483 mentions of Covid-19, covid, pandemic, corona, and virus. \\n\\nY’all have submitted 415,767 words total with 11 words being the most frequent length of a confession.  But confessions come in both the short and the long variety (the longest confession was over 350 words long.\\n \\nTo read all those confessions would be 1512 minutes, or over 25 hours of continuous reading! To read it all out loud would take about 38.5 hours. Y’all must really spend a lot of time reading and writing these confessions, smh…. And writing down all of these confessions on paper would take 548.9 hours - about 23 days. So if you wanna confess to your crush, you should write it in a letter so that they know how much time you’d dedicate to them ;) Oh, and speaking of confessions - we got 671 mentions of Confessions ;)',\n",

As the current admins, we found this instruction simple at first, but over time things became complex as the page grew more popular and more and more people submitted confessions. Retroactively, we realize the change we had made in the posting styles for confessions wasn’t for the better. With that, we want to try to bring confessions back to what it was originally about: to post juicy gossip and stories of things happening in, on, around, or on top of campus. We’re going to attempt bringing the number of political, situational, etc. confessions to zero and give opportunities for other pages, groups, platforms to focus on that stuff. Please bear with us as we try this new system out, but in the meanwhile, give us those juicy confessions!\\n\\nSince we're pinning this post, here's the link as always: https://goo.gl/forms/pUJWtmCtftAESwc53\",\n",

I ask you ALL, regardless of your reaction to this election outcome, to treat each and every one of your fellow students with love and compassion. Such a potentially divisive moment in our nation's journey merits our sincerest devotion to forging unity. We are a microcosm of society, and a really important one at that. We have great minds and hearts at this university with the potential to change the world. Let us reflect on this, but let us push forward, to become the best that we can be, to contribute to our fellow man, and to keep this country moving in a positive direction. Thank you.

       "'#37492 This a response to all who have commented/replied to my response of the “fat is negative” post. I tried to keep it short but yo\\n\\nTo the person who also responded to the original post & another who commented on some of the other posts: thanks for bringing up points that I didn’t touch on & for restating for those who don’t get what body-positivity means and why we are against fat-shaming. I appreciated your posts & hopefully others will take more to your approach *I know I can be more strong-worded and straightforward which can seem “mean”*\\n\\nTo the person with the Epstein last name: I honestly don’t even remember what your comment was; I initially had a response but forgot because your comment was so irrelevant and I could only remember wondering if you were related to the pedophile. \\n\\nTo the original submitter, \\n\\n1. I appreciate that you responded to explain your side of the original post and I empathize with your situation because I also have experienced that. My father passed away 5 years ago  (stroke, pneumonia, pre-diabetes linked to a lifetime of alcoholism, unhealthy eating, stress, etc.) I always knew alcohol would be the reason he died & after seeing for years how he wasted away each day, I developed disgust toward alcohol and anyone who drinks. I can’t be around college kids drinking or at the bar with people binge drinking or even casual drinking. I was angry (and still am) at my dad for not caring about his health and not caring about us, because we would be the ones who would have to survive without him. It felt selfish because he didn’t care for us enough to care about himself. I can relate to the anger (not hateful anger, like that kind of out of love anger), fear, and concern you have toward your mother. However, as someone who has been through that on both sides, I just want to tell you that your feelings are valid but you must also come to terms that no matter how much you love someone or how adjacent you are to them, their life is theirs. Their body is theirs, their choices are theirs, and their reasons are theirs.\\n\\n I have vivid memories of breaking down and begging my father to stop drinking and now I have to go through that again with my brother. For both of them, alcohol is the only way they can cope each throughout the day to do it all over again the next day. It’s easy for someone on the outside to condemn people who rely on alcohol or who don’t seek help when they know they’re destroying their bodies. I know I did. But as my depression got really bad, I realized how it is to be on the other side. Even knowing how something is bad for me, if it helps me through the day I’ll indulge. Anyone in my family who says anything about it is automatically told off because I view it as my mental health, my struggles, my illnesses and no one but me has a say in it. This is just me thought I’m not suggesting I’m right in any way. It’s different on the other side of it but of course we are always going to try to change or help the people we love. And, I’ll admit I never stopped hoping my dad would change, but at the end of the day, they make their own choices and they are human. No one is perfect enough to do right by themselves and everyone in their lives. I’m not sure if you’ll understand what I mean by this, because I’ve only recently begun understanding this in my own situation so my way of trying to explain this is still emotional for me and hard to put into words. Part of what I am trying to say is we need to respect, even if we don’t agree, what others do with their health. \\n\\nYour mother has a lot going on that complicates and interplays on various health conditions. I’m sure her mindset isn’t to  intentionally have her health decline or to lose her job or to have you worry etc. Most people don’t go about their lives hoping for bad health. I pray that your mother lives long enough to see you accomplish your dreams and goals in life. Be there for her through everything she’s going through and love her each day. No one, fat or thin, healthy or ill, rich or poor, has life guaranteed. I can say from my own situation that I was so disgusted and upset and angry with my father’s choices that I made it hard for him to talk to me and be there in my life. I regret that so immensely because I let my righteousness and pride get to me instead of loving him through his pain, through his struggles with alcoholism. We both would have been a little bit happier in life if we just put our judgements, especially me. \\n\\n2. It’s great you brought up how illness also affects those with wealth.  I don’t think I stated that wealth guaranteed health; what I had meant was the association of health and wealth and how that speaks to our capitalistic healthcare system. But it is important to discuss all nuances in the obesity discussion; I believe one point I tried to make was how the fat=unhealthy discussion puts forth this idea that anyone categorized as fat (and we need to think who is deciding these categories) is someone who eats unhealthily and poorly. However, and these stats may be outdated because they’re from a few years ago, wealthy white men were found to be more likely to be obese or overweight. The results showed that wealth allowed for excess eating and *extravagant* eating. This has also been seen in immigrant communities of color who perceive excess eating and weight gain/adiposity as a sign of wealth—primarily a Western ideal of wealth—given that they come from impoverished nations and communities with scarce and poor sources of foods. It’s a sign that they “made it in America” and can care for their families. These cases of overweight and obesity show that overeating is associated with weight gain/obesity, and that not it does not necessarily have to be unhealthy foods. I forgot who said it, but it is something we say in the public health community, overeating of any food will lead to weight gain. People shouldn’t just jump to conclusions and assume they’re stuffing their faces with McDonalds. \\n\\n3. I believe what prompted me to respond to your post in the first place was the statement “I’m interested in other people who are care about their health”. Maybe I interpreted incorrectly and you can explain if you want, but I perceived it as relating to attraction, desire, physicality, etc.; that is what most of my response was directed at. \\n\\n4. In reading your response, I would like to know if you put forth your beliefs about health in regards to the other conditions you have personal experience with or if you only focus on “fat” or obesity. The situation you described seems to be more related to several other causal pathways, with an emphasis on mental health. I think if you focus only on health in relation to weight, based on what you wrote about why you have these beliefs, then that says something about how society singles out overweight and obesity in relation to health and disease. I think someone mentioned in a comment how we don’t target smokers as unhealthy, when we’ve known for decades how extremely unhealthy it is and its association with cancer. Even second hand smoking isn’t properly regulated because of “liberties” that Americans selectively defend. My mother recently was told her lungs are as black as a regular smoker, a result of working in a smoker’s home for a few years. Yet, we don’t see people confronting or harassing smokers in public or over the internet as we do for those who are overweight. \\n\\n5. Apologies for anything in #1 that you may be offended by; I couldn’t form into words what I wanted to share with you but do know that regardless of not knowing you, regardless of the tone and anger in my first post, I am not a hateful person (indignant, yes) so I do wish you the strength needed in your situation.\\n\\nTo the person who called it an eating disorder rant, (I think you were responding to my post?), \\n\\n1. I don’t give a fuck that you don’t feel enough sympathy/pity for me? My post was not about ranting about my disordered eating illnesses and if that’s what you got from it then we really need to sit down and figure out how you got into MIT with those critical analysis skills. I never needed anything from anyone and I definitely do not need your sympathy. I don’t see why you would even write that besides being triggered by what I wrote and needing to repair your fragile ego. \\n\\n2. I have no idea what you’re referring to when you commented that I’m pushing a “it’s not a problem if I don’t make it one” logic. If you mean what I was saying about the effects of socialization, then you really need to analyze better what you’re reading. Also, you’re reaching and projecting by saying my post had few likes/wasn’t validated because I was pushing this logic. It’s laughable. I don’t give a fuck about “likes” lol I’m not posting for “approval” or a hive following. I don’t need validation from anyone. You don’t pay my bills. You don’t decide my future. What the hell would I need from you? I’m used to my statements being met with silence. Students, professors, deans> all stay quiet when I talk. I’m almost certain you would not respond as you did if we were having a class discussion on this or if you were standing in front of me in public.\\n\\n3. Point to where I have stated that overweight and obesity don’t carry health risks. Then, rethink your question of “why can’t you just acknowledge that it’s there” (i.e. association of overweight and obesity with risk factors). *you can’t because I never said that nor implied it*\\n\\n4. “Astronomically higher” : this is a reach that people such as yourself who claim the “extreme dangers of fatness” excuse to push your bias and fat-phobic beliefs. Or, you all simply stick to this because you haven’t truly researched health conditions and rely on inflated and oftentimes incorrectly summarized health research that is also oftentimes biased, incorrectly analyzed, and flawed in design. Yes, there are health risks. I have literally taken a course titled “Obesity in the 21st Century”, written systematic reviews, and I study public health, so if you want to come at me with scientific assumptions of the effects of overweight and obesity then please send me your info and let’s have a legitimate debate, devoid of personal opinion and experience. \\n\\n5. “People are quick to judge. There’s nothing you can do to stop that unless you lose weight”: excuse me? I said in my post that I don’t give a fuck what people say or think about me. I’ll say it again. I DON’T GIVE A FUCK. My choice to aim for a “healthy weight” will be for that: TO BE HEALTHY, NOT FOR PEOPLE TO STOP JUDGING. This is literally the point that I and others have mentioned. The anti-body positivity rhetoric uses the health concern excuse to justify harassment, shaming, and bias of overweight peoples. How about people just stop being dicks in general? Why do I have to “lose weight” to make people not be assholes. Is me being thin going to suddenly make them nonjudgemental and supportive? An asshole is an asshole whether I’m thin or overweight. Being skinny won’t change that but maybe learning to have some basic human decency will. \\n\\n6. When I wrote about my experiences, it was to show how bias, disgust, and fat-shaming is so ingrained in our society that even as children we are already internalizing it and associate thinness with acceptance and love. My paranoia/anxiety in public stemmed from that and the anxiety disorders I struggled with exacerbated it. To be clear, I have never overheard anyone comment on my weight or had anyone tell me directly. I have never been bullied for my weight or anything else like being “smart”. I grew up in the hood so anyone trying to step to me and call me fat or whatever lol go for it. It doesn’t phase me. I’ve had guns pointed at my face,  I’ve stepped to gang leaders, I’ve had my dad try to choke me out. I’m not afraid of someone who thinks their dominance or power lies in their “thinness” and fat-phobic comments. \\n\\n7. Again, “astronomically higher/more likely”: Lol I’ve been a size 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 in the short life span I’ve had. My weight fluctuates so extremely because of the effects of disordered eating and PTSD. So if by June I’m back down to a size 2/4, are you going to redact your statement? Health doesn’t work like that. If someone with health complications reduces their weight, those complications don’t simply disappear. Even for those who “get fit” after being overweight or obese throughout their life aren’t free from future illness or increased risks;\\n Unlike your ridiculous assumption, growing up I was “astronomically more likely” to die from domestic/inter-partner violence, effects of poverty, gang violence, police brutality, etc. Now, I am “astronomically more likely” to die from the effects/complications of life-long PTSD, depression, anxiety, and childhood sexual assault, not obesity-related illnesses as you claim. I am “astronomically more likely to die of [any] heart disease” related to PTSD THAN OVERWEIGHT. If you knew the basics of statistical analysis and health research, then you know that risks for illness or premature death are not as simple to associate (and cannot be causally associated) as seeing someone overweight and stating heart disease will kill them. Do you even know the various risk factors for each heart disease? Do you know my health status? I don’t remember you taking samples of my blood to test or examining my body for potential signs of “heart disease” or other related conditions. \\nRegardless of the sizes I have been, I have always maintained a physical baseline when it comes to fitness. I don’t know why, maybe it’s because my body is so accustomed to drastic changes that it adapts quickly, but at my heaviest and at my lowest I have always maintained the same mile time and physical stamina. Regardless of weight gain, I have always tried to eat healthily when money allows> no more meat/dairy/processed foods = no more gastrointestinal stress, no more bloating, no more sluggishness; I do not smoke, I do not drink, I do not consume refined sugars, I do not consume highly processed foods, I do not consume chemical-filled foods; I do not get sick, I do not feel winded or stressed when doing low-intensity or high-intensity work outs; I am healthy, but I am overweight. My mother has never been overweight, she is 85 lbs and she is type 2 diabetic; she had to have her thyroid removed, along with many other complications; her mother, also thin, died from type 2 diabetes complications. Would you ever have told her without knowing her health status that she is “ASTRONOMICALLY MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM HEART DISEASE”? \\nHer condition is not only *possibly* related to genetics (as diabetes research is still not well understood especially in terms of the genetic component), but it is related to unhealthy eating in terms of highly processed foods, high-sodium content, high-fat content; she has rarely, I can’t even think of one case, eaten out at fast food places or restaurants; she doesn’t stuff her face with ice cream, chips, and all the other crap you all assume people with diabetes eat. This is a result of unhealthy food content offered in impoverished places. Try going to a grocery store in the hood compared to your local Whole Foods and compare the contents. Even in the “healthy” foods, the content is poor and not actually healthy. ***I wonder why fruits and vegetables are twice as expensive and half as fresh and healthy in low-income neighborhoods***\\nALSO, since you want to state your **facts** so much, I’d like to see you go to the NFL players and tell them they’re overweight and “astronomically more likely to die from heart disease” and to “lose weight”. Have you seen the heavyweight boxer Ruiz who TKO’d AJ? I’d like to see you go up to him and tell him what you’re judging about me. Tell him he’s fat and needs to lose weight. Tell him he’s “astronomically more likely to die from heart disease” and needs to admit there are actual health risks to be concerned about. Tell him he needs to “improve on” his weight. These people are insanely more athletic than either of us, yet they technically qualify as overweight. A close friend of mine who is an ex-MMA fighter and current MMA/Boxing/BJJ trainer, almost died from a heart attack last year. He’s ridiculously fit and trains every day but doesn’t monitor his eating and eats high-fat foods. Is it guaranteed that ONLY OVERWEIGHT, NONFIT PEOPLE SUFFER HEALTH COMPLICATIONS? In case you didn’t know,  ***BMI IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL AND RELIES ON A WHITE-CENTRIC BODY IDEAL/PHYSIQUE***'"
