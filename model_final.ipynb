As students at MIT, we should have the freedom to curate our own education rather than being forced into a one-size-fits-all system that doesn’t reflect our individual goals or the innovative spirit that MIT prides itself on. We are adults capable of making our own choices, and it’s time for the administration to recognize that.', 'sampled_confession': \"#75421: For those of you who filled out the Waffle Wednesday form today. There were two other questions at the end of the form: “How would you feel if the highest meal plan (225 or 21/week) was mandatory for all first-years?” and “The DSL Dining Advisory Group (not a part of the UA) are thinking of making meal plans mandatory for all first-years. How do you feel about meal plans (size undisclosed) being mandatory for MIT undergraduate students?”. I’m glad I screenshotted them, since those questions were quickly removed from the form. The questions were not supposed to be there in the first place, since UA dining people swore to secrecy this information from DSL, but there was a miscommunication. Admin does not want us knowing that they’re going to do this, and they also do not care about students' opinions on the matter since they aren't even open to giving a survey.\\n\\nMIT is one of very few universities in the country that currently allows first years to live in cook for yourself communities, with no meal plan required. Admin will say that they’re changing this because they care about students' health and nutrition, and first years aren’t mature enough to cook for themselves, despite the fact that they’ve been doing it for decades. However, it is literally the same price as a meal plan to eat out in kendall/central every day, the food is better, there are more vegetarian options, etc. College students are adults. We can go grocery shopping and use a microwave at the very least, and it should be our choice to do so. This is an obvious cash grab and an attack on what makes MIT unique and what allows MIT students to be independent.
